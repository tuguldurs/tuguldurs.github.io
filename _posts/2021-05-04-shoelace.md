Just stumbled upon this powerful python package for audio analysis - [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) (see also [McFee et al.](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/pdfs/brian_mcfee.pdf)). Extracting and editing waveforms, decomposing into percussive and harmonic components are all single liners; furthermore it makes tasks like synchronization, Laplacian segmentation, and stream handling super easy. Here is a sample decomposition of Rammstein's song:

```python
np.abs(np.dot(x, np.roll(y, 1)) - np.dot(y, np.roll(x, 1))) / 2.
```
