I studied astrophysics at University of Calfironia Santa Cruz (PhD, 2016), and spent several years working as a research scientist at the Ohio State University, including as NASA Hubble fellow. Here is my full [academic CV](/files/CV.pdf).

My work was primarily focused on improving our theoretical understanding on the lives and deaths of massive stars. This entails hydrodynamics calculations, mostly in spherical symmetry but sometimes in multi-dimensions, coupled with either radiation- or neutrino-transport, while often carrying a large nuclear reaction network as well. Broadly, these models utilize known physics to make testable predictions about the evolution and explosion (sometimes implosion) of massive stars, which were then compared to cutting edge astronomical measurements.

Over the years I have published about 30 peer-reviewed papers in the top journals ([GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WeZtOyMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=sukhbold&searchtype=all&source=header), [NASA-ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=sukhbold&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)). By far my most influential piece of work was [Sukhbold et al. (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...821...38S/abstract), in which we proposed a novel approach for simulating calibrated neutrino-driven stellar explosions, and in some small way it set a new standard in the field. It was among the top 50 (out of ~20,000) astronomy papers published in 2016, with a current citation of 470 (as of mid 2021).

Since 2015, I gave 30 invited seminars and colloquiums throughout the U.S. (all international invites were declined due to a personal reason). I have also frequently served as a referee to various journals ([ApJ](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0004-637X), [MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras), [Nature Astronomy](https://www.nature.com/natastron/), [A&A](https://www.aanda.org/)), and to government funding agencies ([NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=AST) and [NASA](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/) - ATP, FINESST, ADAP).

While at Ohio State I organized one medium size [workshop](https://ccapp.osu.edu/workshops/midwest-workshop-supernovae-and-transients) in 2019, co-organized [TeVPa](https://tevpa2017.osu.edu/) and [CCAPP seminar](https://ccapp.osu.edu/events/current-seminars) series, and used to run the weekly supernova group meetings since 2016. I also had a chance to closely work with several outstanding students including [Rachel Patton](https://astronomy.osu.edu/people/patton.502), with whom I published 2 papers that form part of her PhD thesis work.
