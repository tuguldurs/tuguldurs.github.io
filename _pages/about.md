I am a data scientist generally interested in machine learning, data visualization, and blockchain technology. My current [projects](/datsci/) include neural net based medical ultrasound image processing, bitcoin price prediction, and marriage smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.

My background is in theoretical and computational [astrophysics](/astro/) - over the years I wrote nearly 30 papers about exploding stars in top peer-reviewed journals. Completed my PhD in 2016 (@ UC Santa Cruz), and in the past worked as a NASA Hubble Fellow (@ Ohio State).

Here is my [resume]() and [academic CV](/files/CV.pdf).
