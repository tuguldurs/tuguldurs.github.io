I am a principal data scientist @ [Radiology Partners](https://www.radpartners.com/), working primarily on problems involving computer vision, NLP, and big data.

In a previous life I used to be a theoretical and computational [astrophysics](/astro/) - over the years I wrote over 30 papers about exploding stars in top peer-reviewed journals. Completed my PhD in 2016 (@ UC Santa Cruz), and in the past worked as a NASA Hubble Fellow (@ Ohio State).

Here is my [resume](/files/resume.pdf) and [academic CV](/files/CV.pdf).
