I am a scientist generally interested in machine learning, computer vision, data visualization, and the blockchain technology. My current [projects](/projs/) include medical ultrasound image processing, 3D volumetric reconstruction based on MRI imaging, prediction of GPS coordinates for maize fields in east Africa, and short term capital gains tax utility for crypto trade reports.

My background is in theoretical and computational [astrophysics](/astro/) - over the years I wrote over 30 papers about exploding stars in top peer-reviewed journals. Completed my PhD in 2016 (@ UC Santa Cruz), and in the past worked as a NASA Hubble Fellow (@ Ohio State).

Here is my [resume](/files/resume.pdf) and [academic CV](/files/CV.pdf).
